# 🚀 Senior ETL Developer | Data Architect | Technical Lead | Data Engineer | Analyst

With over 10 years of experience across Healthcare, Insurance, Life Sciences, and Pharma, I specialize in building and optimizing end-to-end data integration and migration solutions using industry-leading tools and cloud platforms. I bring a powerful blend of technical expertise, strategic problem-solving, and team leadership to every project I touch.

I’ve successfully led migrations from Informatica PowerCenter to BDM and IICS, modernized legacy systems, and driven large-scale cloud transitions to AWS and Azure, while ensuring data quality, governance, and performance. Whether it’s developing ETL pipelines, automating workflows, transforming data for analytics, or syncing real-time records between Oracle DB, Salesforce, and S3, I turn complex challenges into scalable, efficient solutions.

To stay aligned with emerging technologies, I am currently upskilling in AWS (Solutions Architect track), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Databricks, PySpark, and exploring how Generative AI can enhance data workflows and productivity. This continuous learning helps me stay future-ready and offer innovative solutions in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.
